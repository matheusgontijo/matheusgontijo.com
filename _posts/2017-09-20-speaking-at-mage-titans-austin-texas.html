<p><strong><a href="http://magetitans.com/" target="_blank">Magento Titans</a></strong> is a worldwide event, gathering the most brilliant minds of Magento world to the same place. Unlike other business conferences, the main focus here is to dig deeply into technical subjects. The event's motto is <span class="text-underline">"an event for Magento developers, designed and curated by Magento developers"</span>.</p>

<p>The 2017 event in the USA took place in <strong>Austin, Texas</strong>. The city is also the capital of Texas and is well known for being the "Live Music Capital of the World".</p>

<h2>My Talk</h2>

<p>I talked about <strong class="text-underline">Clean Code, Object Calisthenics & Best Practices</strong>. When we go to soccer, basketball, MMA, or any sport, we realize that training is a key component of the culture. Nonetheless, in the programming world, it's not as popular. Greatness comes with practice, exercising, performing over and over again. Thus I brought together a collection (well, I really think so) of the "exercices" for the Magento community. You can checkout the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/matheusgontijo/object-calisthenics-for-magento-magetitans-usa-2017" target="_blank">presentation slides here</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PL98ECuxj4" target="_blank">recorded video</a>.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<h3>Good quality speakers</h3>

<p>As I said in the beggining of the post, brilliant minds of the ecosystem were around, talking, discussing and hanging out. I believe it's extremely important being in such environment, not only to listen to the talks, but to connect and have a good time with speakers throughout the day: discussing relevant subjects, asking tough questions, and engaging.</p>

<h3>Made Demo</h3>

<p>For the first time, there were a set of live presentations on the stage of 15 minutes each, with "no powerpoint" allowed, just live demo. The idea was to create a moment of innovation where developers would present some new features, bringing new ideas to the ecosystem. The best demo was judged by the audience. The prize for the 1st was $500 and 2nd $100.</p>

<h3>Affordable Price</h3>

<p>It's important to have as many people as possible. Starting from ‚âà$200 early bird to ‚âà$350 last minute.</p>

<h3>Friendly Staff</h3>

<p>I'm sure all the attendes and speakers can agree on how hard the staff worked and how serious they wanted to make this event unique. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/wagento" target="_blank">@wagento</a> team for all efforts!</p>

<h3>Delicious food! <em>(for real, really really good)</em></h3>

<p>We had an awesome lunch with Texan Barbecue and Tacos! Oh my goodness, how I miss that food! By the way, it was already included in ticket.</p>

<h3>Strong Magento Staff presence</h3>

<p>As Magento Inc. has one of its offices in the city, a considerable amount people of staff were present. I could talk with a lot of them and they were extremelly accessible, willing to talk and friendly.</p>
